              <h2>What is SDI?</h2>
              <p>
                  Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) is the backbone of modern geospatial information systems. It provides a framework for efficiently discovering, accessing, sharing, and managing geospatial data and related resources across multiple organizations and domains. Omoniyi Ikuomola's project is dedicated to enhancing the security and efficiency of SDI for effective water monitoring.
